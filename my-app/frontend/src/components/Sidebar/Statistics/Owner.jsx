      <div className={styles.description}>
        Many nations and private companies have deployed satellites in the past
        decades. However, several countries with influential markets have
        dominated space exploration and commercialization efforts. The five most
        significant owners of satellites up to 2023 are the United States,
        China, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan. These countries have the
        most extensive satellite fleets and are the ones who have invested the
        most resources in public and private spending. These statistics are per
        single country only, not the space agencies of that country, even though
        space agency such as ESA together with its member states has also
        significantly contributed to the development of the current space
        infrastructure.Â
